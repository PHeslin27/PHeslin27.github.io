            <p>My name is Patrick Heslin and I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National University of Ireland under the Dr. Éamon de Valera Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Mathematical Sciences.

                Before this I was a Dean’s Post-Doctoral Scholar in the Department of Mathematics at Florida State University working under Prof. Martin Bauer.
                
                I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Notre Dame in 2021 under the supervision of Prof. Gerard Misiołek.
                
                My research interests lie primarily in the geometry and analysis of non-linear partial differential equations arising in fluid dynamics and other areas of mathematical physics. The bulk of this work takes place in the setting of infinite-dimensional Riemannian geometry and hence incorporates tools from finite-dimensional geometry, functional and harmonic analysis as well as partial differential equations.</p>
